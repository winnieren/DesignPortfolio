        <h1>Context</h1>
        <p>Groq is a machine learning systems company building easy to use, high TOPS/Watt accelerators with sub-millisecond latency. </p>
        <p>Despite being hired as a software engineering intern, I got to own an entire project end-to-end (working with another developer to code the back-end). Emerging out of stealth phase, Groq needed to an internal monitoring system, which gave me the opportunity to create a monitor system with data visualization aimed at a variety of different users.</p>

            <div class="textWrapper">
                <p>For this project, I employed a less structured iterative design process as rather the importance of backend functionality far outweighted the user experience. Thus, after the first mockup was finished and approved, I quickly moved to developing the first usable prototype. Following this trend, the iterative feedback was also immediately implemented into an updated version of the application in code form.</p>

            <p>Although I cannot go into detail about the project, I can say that the system impacted the experience of many within and outside of the company.</p>
            <p class="bolded">Expedited workflow</p>
            <p>The creation of this monitoring greatly benefited the engineers by automating various tasks resulting in months of excess work being eliminated.</p>

        <h1>Protected under NDA</h1>
        <p>The majority of the project I worked on is under an NDA, so I cannot show any images or go into detail regarding the functions. However, I’ve outlined my design process and highlighted the product results here! I would also love to go over my design decision process (it involves a beloved decision matrix!) through <a class="bolded" src="mailto:wrjren@uwaterloo.ca" >email</a>, a call or over some coffee/bubble tea.</p>
